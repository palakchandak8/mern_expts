# MERN Experiments Repository

This repository contains all the lab experiments for my MERN stack course. Each experiment is encapsulated within its own HTML file, fully demonstrating key web development concepts in action.

##  Repository Structure

Experiments are organized by file name:
- `expt1.doc` – version control git 
- `expt2.html` – advance JS
- …and so on.

All files are located in the root directory for easy access and deployment.

##  How to View an Experiment Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/palakchandak8/mern_expts.git
   cd mern_expts
